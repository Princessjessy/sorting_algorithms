0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
An introductory project on:

different sorting algorithms
What is the Big O notation, and how to evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm
How to select the best sorting algorithm for a given input
What is a stable sorting algorithm
Requirements
files should be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
File Descriptions
print_array - Prints an array of integers

print_list - Prints a list of integers

Mandatory
0-bubble_sort.c - sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the Bubble sort algorithm

prints the array after each time you swap two elements
0-O - contains the big O notations of the time complexity of the Bubble sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

in the best case
in the average case
in the worst case
1-insertion_sort_list.c - sorts a doubly linked list of integers in ascending order using the Insertion sort algorithm

not allowed to modify the integer n of a node. You have to swap the nodes themselves
prints the list after each time you swap two elements
1-O - contains the big O notations of the time complexity of the Insertion sort algorithm, with 1 notation per line:

in the best case
in the average case
in the worst case
